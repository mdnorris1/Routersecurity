# Router security
You have a small business network connected to the internet through a single router as shown in the network diagram. You have noticed that three hosts on the internet have been flooding your router with unwanted traffic. As a temporary measure, you want to prevent all communication from these three hosts until the issue is resolved.

In this lab, your task is to:

Create a Standard Access List 25.
Add statements to the access list to block traffic from the following hosts:
199.68.111.199
202.177.9.1
211.55.67.11
Add a statement to allow all other traffic from all other hosts.
Apply Access List 25 to the Serial0/0/0 interface to filter incoming traffic.
You can also use 199.68.111.199 0.0.0.0 (without the host parameter) to identify a specific host. You can also use 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 to identify any host. Because this is a temporary solution, you do not need to save your changes.
